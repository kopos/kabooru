INSERT INTO `articles` VALUES (1,'Domain Specific Languages','<br><br>There are several usage patterns for domain-specific languages: <br>domain-specific languages which operate standalone, and are called via direct user operation (often on the command line or from a Makefile), like GraphViz.<br>\ndomain-specific languages which are implemented using programming language macro systems, and which are converted or expanded into a host General Purpose Language at compile-time or read-time.<br>domain-specific languages are called (at runtime) from programs written in General Purpose Languages like C or Perl, to perform a specific function, often returning the results of operation to the &quot;host&quot; programming language for further processing. Generally, an interpreter or virtual machine for the domain-specific language is embedded into the host application.<br>\ndomain-specific languages are embedded into user applications, like macro languages within spreadsheets, and they are used to execute code that is written by users of the application, dynamically generated by the application, or both. <br>\n<br>Many domain-specific languages can be used in more than one way: GraphViz can be run on a command line, there are Perl modules which output GraphViz data, and GraphViz has been embedded into other applications as a visualization component. <br>\n<br> <br>[edit] Context <br><br>A domain-specific language is created specifically to solve problems in a particular domain and is not intended to be able to solve problems outside it (although that may be technically possible). In contrast, General-purpose programming languages are created to solve problems in many domains. <br>\n<br>The domain can also be a business area. Some examples of business areas include: <br>domain-specific language for life insurance policies developed internally in large insurance enterprise<br>domain-specific language for combat simulation<br>\ndomain-specific language for salary calculation<br>domain-specific language for billing <br><br>A domain-specific language is somewhere between a tiny programming language and a scripting language, and is often used in a way analogous to a programming library. The boundaries between these concepts are quite blurry, much like the boundary between scripting languages and general-purpose languages. <br>\n<br>Domain-specific languages are languages (or most often, declared syntaxes or grammars) with very specific goals in design and implementation. A domain-specific language can be either a visual diagramming languages, such as those created by the Generic Eclipse Modeling System or the Generic Modeling Environment, programatic abstractions, such as the Eclipse Modeling Framework, or textual languages. For instance, the command line utility grep has a regular expression syntax which matches patterns in lines of text. The sed utility defines a syntax for matching and replacing regular expressions. Often, these tiny languages can be used together inside a shell to perform more complex programming tasks. <br>\n<br>The line between domain-specific languages and scripting programming languages is somewhat blurred, but domain-specific languages often lack low-level functions for filesystem access, interprocess control, and other functions that characterize full-featured programming languages, scripting or otherwise. Many domain-specific languages do not compile to byte-code or executable code, but to various kinds of media objects: GraphViz exports to PostScript, GIF, JPEG, etc, where Csound compiles to audio files, and a ray-tracing domain-specific language like POV compiles to graphics files. A computer language like SQL presents an interesting case: it can be deemed a domain-specific language because it is specific to a specific domain (in SQL&#39;s case, accessing and managing relational databases), and is often called from another application, but SQL has more keywords and functions than many scripting languages, and is often thought of as a language in its own right, perhaps because of the prevalence of database manipulation in programming and the amount of mastery required to be an expert in the language. <br>\n<br>Further blurring this line, many domain-specific languages have exposed APIs, and can be accessed from other programming languages without breaking the flow of execution or calling a separate process, and can thus operate as programming libraries. <br>\n<br>Some domain-specific languages expand over time to include full-featured programming tools, which further complicates the question of whether a language is domain-specific or not. A good example is the functional language XSLT, specifically designed for transforming one XML graph into another, which has been extended since its inception to allow (particularly in its 2.0 version) for various forms of filesystem interaction, string and date manipulation, and data typing. <br>\n<br>In Model Driven Engineering many examples of domain-specific languages may be found like OCL, a language for decorating models with assertions or QVT, a domain specific transformation language. However languages like UML are typically general purpose modeling languages. <br>\n<br>To summarize, an analogy might be useful: a Very Little Language is like a knife, which can be used in thousands of different ways, from cutting food to cutting down trees. A domain-specific language is like an electric drill: it is a powerful tool with a wide variety of uses, but a specific context, namely, putting holes in things (although it might also be used to mix paint or remove screws). A General Purpose Language is a complete workbench, with a variety of tools intended for performing a variety of tasks. domain-specific languages should be used by programmers who, looking at their current workbench, realize they need a better drill, and find that a specific domain-specific language provides exactly that. <br>\n<br> <br><br><br>-- <br>-Suman<br> \n\n',1,NULL,1,953125641,'2008-02-06 12:52:48','2008-02-06 12:52:48'),(2,'RUBY Programming Lanugage',' <br> <br> <br> <br>Ruby (programming language) <br> <br>From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia <br>Jump to: navigation, search <br> <br> The introduction of this article is too short.<br> To comply with Wikipedia&#39;s lead section guidelines, it should be expanded.<br>\n Please discuss this on the talk page and read the lead section guide to ensure it summarizes the article. <br> Ruby <br> <br> Paradigm multi-paradigm <br> Appeared in 1995 <br> Designed by Yukihiro Matsumoto <br> Developer Yukihiro Matsumoto (among others) <br>\n Latest release 1.9.0/ December 25, 2007 <br> Typing discipline dynamic (&quot;duck&quot;) <br> Major implementations Ruby, JRuby, Rubinius <br> Influenced by Smalltalk, Perl, Lisp, Scheme, Python, CLU, Eiffel, Ada, Dylan <br>\n Influenced Groovy <br> OS Cross-platform <br> License Ruby License<br> GNU General Public License <br> Website  <br><br>Ruby is a reflective, dynamic, object-oriented programming language.

Ruby 1.9.0 was released in December, but it is considered a development release. Several virtual machines are being developed for Ruby. These include JRuby, a port of Ruby to the Java platform, IronRuby, an implementation for the .NET Framework produced by Microsoft, and Rubinius, an interpreter modeled after self-hosting Smalltalk virtual machines. The main developers have thrown their weight behind the virtual machine provided by the YARV project, which was merged into the Ruby source tree on 31 December 2006, and released as part of Ruby 1.9. <br>\n<br> <br>[edit] Philosophy <br><br>The language&#39;s creator, Yukihiro &quot;Matz&quot; Matsumoto, has said that Ruby is designed for programmer productivity and fun, following the principles of good user interface design.[2] He stresses that systems design needs to emphasize human, rather than computer, needs [3]: <br>\n \" Often people, especially computer engineers, focus on the machines. They think, &quot;By doing this, the machine will run faster. By doing this, the machine will run more effectively. By doing this, the machine will something something something.&quot; They are focusing on machines. But in fact we need to focus on humans, on how humans care about doing programming or operating the application of the machines. We are the masters. They are the slaves. \" <br>\n<br>Ruby is said to follow the principle of least surprise (POLS), meaning that the language should behave in such a way as to minimize confusion for experienced users. Matsumoto has said his primary design goal was to make a language that he himself enjoyed using, by minimizing programmer work and possible confusion. He has said he hadn&#39;t applied the principle of least surprise to the design of Ruby,[4] but nevertheless the phrase has come to be closely associated with the Ruby programming language. The phrase has itself been a source of surprise, as novice users may take it to mean that Ruby&#39;s behaviors try to closely match behaviors familiar from other languages. In a May 2005 discussion on the comp.lang.ruby newsgroup, Matsumoto attempted to distance Ruby from POLS, explaining that because any design choice will be surprising to someone, he uses a personal standard in evaluating surprise. If that personal standard remains consistent there will be few surprises for those familiar with the standard. [1] <br>\n<br>Matsumoto defined it this way in an interview [2]: <br> \" Everyone has an individual background. Someone may come from Python, someone else may come from Perl, and they may be surprised by different aspects of the language. Then they come up to me and say, &#39;I was surprised by this feature of the language, so Ruby violates the principle of least surprise.&#39; Wait. Wait. The principle of least surprise is not for you only. The principle of least surprise means principle of least my surprise. And it means the principle of least surprise after you learn Ruby very well. For example, I was a C++ programmer before I started designing Ruby. I programmed in C++ exclusively for two or three years. And after two years of C++ programming, it still surprises me. \" <br>\n<br> <br>[edit] Semantics <br><br>Ruby is object-oriented: every data type is an object, including even classes and types that many other languages designate as primitives (such as integers, booleans, and &quot;nil&quot;). Every function is a method. Named values (variables) always designate references to objects, not the objects themselves. Ruby supports inheritance with dynamic dispatch, mixins and singleton methods (belonging to, and defined for, a single instance rather than being defined on the class). Though Ruby does not support multiple inheritance, classes can import modules as mixins. Procedural syntax is supported, but all methods defined outside of the scope of a particular object are actually methods of the Object class. Since this class is parent to every other class, the changes become visible to all classes and objects. <br>\n<br>Ruby has been described as a multi-paradigm programming language: it allows procedural programming (defining functions/variables outside classes makes them part of the root, &#39;self&#39; Object), with object orientation (everything is an object) or functionally (it has anonymous functions, closures, and continuations; statements all have values, and functions return the last evaluation). It has support for introspection, reflection and metaprogramming, as well as support for interpreter-based[5] threads. Ruby features dynamic typing, and supports parametric polymorphism. <br>\n<br>According to the Ruby FAQ [6], &quot;If you like Perl, you will like Ruby and be right at home with its syntax. If you like Smalltalk, you will like Ruby and be right at home with its semantics. If you like Python, you may or may not be put off by the huge difference in design philosophy between Python and Ruby/Perl.&quot; [7] <br>\n<br> <br>[edit] Type system <br><br>Ruby checks the type of each expression and sub-expression dynamically, as they are encountered during execution, and will raise a runtime error whenever a type-error is found. <br><br>\n <br>[edit] Is Ruby type-safe? <br><br>There is no universally agreed upon definition of type-safe (see TypeSafe at <a href=\"http://C2.com\">C2.com</a> Wiki), and in the case of Ruby, it depends on which definition one refers to. <br>\n<br>One definition of type-safe language requires that &quot;no operation will be applied to a variable of a wrong type.&quot; In this respect, Ruby is probably type-safe (given Ruby&#39;s semantics, it would be very difficult to prove theoretically, but might be assumed as long as no contradictory code-example is found). <br>\n<br>Another definition of type-safe program requires that &quot;the program will not have type errors when it runs&quot;. In this respect, Ruby is obviously not type-safe, since it may by design raise type-errors during execution. <br>\n<br> <br>[edit] Is Ruby strongly typed? <br><br>Again, there is no universally agreed upon definition of Strongly Typed. <a href=\"http://C2.com\">C2.com</a> Wiki lists at least 8 different definitions from different sources. <br>\n<br>It seems, according to some of these definitions, Ruby is strongly-typed, while according to others it is weakly-typed. So to answer this question, one would first at least have to decide upon what definition to use: <br>\nDef: A language is strongly typed if type annotations are associated with variable names, rather than with values. If types are attached to values, it is weakly typed. =&gt; Ruby is weakly typed.<br>Def: A language is strongly typed if it contains compile-time checks for type constraint violations. If checking is deferred to run time, it is weakly typed. =&gt; Ruby is weakly typed.<br>\nDef: A language is strongly typed if there are compile-time or run-time checks for type constraint violations. If no checking is done, it is weakly typed. =&gt; Ruby is strongly typed.<br>Def: A language is strongly typed if conversions between different types are forbidden. If such conversions are allowed, it is weakly typed. =&gt; Ruby is weakly typed.<br>\nDef: A language is strongly typed if conversions between different types must be indicated explicitly. If implicit conversions are performed, it is weakly typed. =&gt; Ruby is weakly typed. (Examples: (2+3.5) (implicit conversion Fixnum to Float) and (if 42 then &quot;a&quot; else &quot;b&quot; end) (implicit conversion from Fixnum to TrueClass))<br>\nDef: A language is strongly typed if there is no language-level way to disable or evade the type system. If there are casts or other type-evasive mechanisms, it is weakly typed. =&gt; Ruby is assumed to be strongly typed, but very difficult to prove mathematically.<br>\nDef: A language is strongly typed if it has a complex, fine-grained type system with compound types. If it has only a few types, or only scalar types, it is weakly typed. =&gt; Ruby is strongly typed.<br>Def: A language is strongly typed if the type of its data objects is fixed and does not vary over the lifetime of the object. If the type of a datum can change, the language is weakly typed. =&gt; Ruby is weakly typed. (Example: x = 1; x = &quot;s&quot;. Type of x changes from Fixnum to String.) <br>\n<br> <br>[edit] Features <br>object-oriented<br>four levels of variable scope: global, class, instance, and local<br>exception handling<br>iterators and closures (based on passing blocks of code)<br>native, Perl-like regular expressions at the language level<br>\noperator overloading<br>automatic garbage collecting<br>highly portable<br>cooperative multi-threading on all platforms using green threads<br>DLL/shared library dynamic loading on most platforms<br>introspection, reflection and metaprogramming<br>\nlarge standard library<br>supports dependency injection<br>supports object runtime alteration[8]<br>continuations and generators (examples in RubyGarden: continuations and generators) <br><br>Ruby currently lacks full support for Unicode, though it has partial support for UTF-8. <br>\n<br> <br>[edit] Interaction See also: Interactive Ruby Shell <br><br>The Ruby official distribution also includes &quot;irb&quot;, an interactive command-line interpreter which can be used to test code quickly. The following code fragment represents a sample session using irb: <br>\n $ irb<br>irb(main):001:0&gt; puts &quot;Hello, World&quot;<br>Hello, World<br>=&gt; nil<br>irb(main):002:0&gt; 1+2<br>=&gt; 3<br><br> <br><br> <br>[edit] Syntax <br><br>The syntax of Ruby is broadly similar to Perl and Python. Class and method definitions are signaled by keywords. In contrast to Perl, variables are not obligatorily prefixed with a sigil. When used, the sigil changes the semantics of scope of the variable. The most striking difference from C and Perl is that keywords are typically used to define logical code blocks, without braces (i.e., pair of { and }). Line breaks are significant and taken as the end of a statement; a semicolon may be equivalently used. Unlike Python, indentation is not significant. <br>\n<br>One of the differences of Ruby compared to Python and Perl is that Ruby keeps all of its instance variables completely private to the class and only exposes them through accessor methods (attr_writer, attr_reader, etc). Unlike the &quot;getter&quot; and &quot;setter&quot; methods of other languages like C++ or Java, accessor methods in Ruby can be written with a single line of code. As invocation of these methods does not require the use of parentheses, it is trivial to change an instance variable into a full function, without modifying a single line of code or having to do any refactoring achieving similar functionality to C# and <a href=\"http://VB.NET\">VB.NET</a> property members. Python&#39;s property descriptors are similar, but come with a tradeoff in the development process. If one begins in Python by using a publicly exposed instance variable and later changes the implementation to use a private instance variable exposed through a property descriptor, code internal to the class may need to be adjusted to use the private variable rather than the public property. Ruby removes this design decision by forcing all instance variables to be private, but also provides a simple way to declare set and get methods. This is in keeping with the idea that in Ruby, one never directly accesses the internal members of a class from outside of it. Rather one passes a message to the class and receives a response. <br>\n<br>See the examples section for samples of code demonstrating Ruby syntax. <br><br> <br>[edit] &quot;Gotchas&quot; <br><br> <br>[edit] Language comparison <br><br>Some features that differ notably from languages such as C or Perl: <br>\nNames that begin with a capital letter are treated as constants, so local variables should begin with a lowercase letter.<br>The sigils $ @ do not indicate variable data type as in Perl, but rather function as scope resolution operators.<br>\nTo denote floating point numbers, one must follow with a zero digit (99.0) or an explicit conversion (99.to_f). It is insufficient to append a dot (99.), because numbers are susceptible to method syntax.<br>Boolean evaluation of non-boolean data is strict: 0, &quot;&quot; and [] are all evaluated to true. In C, the expression 0 ? 1 : 0 evaluates to 0 (i.e. false). In Ruby, however, it yields 1, as all numbers evaluate to true; only nil and false evaluate to false. A corollary to this rule is that Ruby methods by convention â€” for example, regular-expression searches â€” return numbers, strings, lists, or other non-false values on success, but nil on failure (e.g., mismatch). This convention is also used in Smalltalk, where only the special objects true and false can be used in a boolean expression.<br>\nVersions prior to 1.9 lack a character data type (compare to C, which provides type char for characters). This may cause surprises when slicing strings: &quot;abc&quot;[0] yields 97 (an integer, representing the ASCII code of the first character in the string); to obtain &quot;a&quot; use &quot;abc&quot;[0,1] (a substring of length 1) or &quot;abc&quot;[0].chr.<br>\nThe notation &quot;statement until expression&quot;, despite the English-language implication that the statement would be executed at least once, which follows the precedent used in other languages&#39; equivalent statements (e.g. &quot;do { statement } while (not(expression));&quot; in C/C++/...), actually never runs the statement if the expression is already true.<br>\nBecause constants are references to objects, changing what a constant refers to generates a warning, but modifying the object itself does not. For example, if Greeting = &quot;Hello&quot; then Greeting &lt;&lt; &quot; world!&quot; does not generate an error or warning. This is similar to final variables in Java, but Ruby does also have the functionality to &quot;freeze&quot; an object, unlike Java. <br>\n<br>Some features that differ notably from other languages: <br>The usual operators for conditional expressions, and and or, do not follow the normal rules of precedence: and does not bind tighter than or. Ruby also has expression operators || and &amp;&amp; which work as expected. <br>\n<br> <br>[edit] Language features <br>In terms of speed, Ruby&#39;s performance is inferior to that of many compiled languages (as is any interpreted language) and other major scripting languages such as Python and Perl[9]. However, in future releases (current revision: 1.9), Ruby will be bytecode compiled to be executed on YARV (Yet Another Ruby VM). Currently, Ruby&#39;s memory footprint for the same operations is higher than Perl&#39;s and Python&#39;s.[9]<br>\nOmission of parentheses around method arguments may lead to unexpected results if the methods take multiple parameters. Note that the Ruby developers have stated that omission of parentheses on multi-parameter methods may be disallowed in future Ruby versions, the Ruby interpreter currently (Nov 2007) throws a warning which encourages the writer to not omit (), to avoid ambiguous meaning of code. Not using () is however still common practise, and can be especially nice to use Ruby as a human readable domain-specific language itself, along with the method called method_missing(). <br>\n<br>A list of &quot;gotchas&quot; may be found in Hal Fulton&#39;s book The Ruby Way, 2nd ed (ISBN 0-672-32884-4), Section 1.5. A similar list in the 1st edition pertained to an older version of Ruby (version 1.6), some problems of which have been fixed in the meantime. retry, for example, now works with while, until, and for, as well as iterators. <br>\n<br> <br>[edit] Examples <br><br>The following examples can be run in a Ruby shell such as Interactive Ruby Shell or saved in a file and run from the command line by typing ruby &lt;filename&gt;. <br><br>Classic Hello world example: <br>\n puts &quot;Hello World!&quot;<br><br> <br><br>Some basic Ruby code: <br> # Everything, including a literal, is an object, so this works:<br>-199.abs # 199<br>&quot;ruby is cool&quot;.length # 12<br>&quot;Rick&quot;.index(&quot;c&quot;) # 2<br>\n&quot;Nice Day Isn&#39;t It?&quot;.downcase.split(//).sort.uniq.join # &quot; &#39;?acdeinsty&quot;<br><br> <br><br>Conversions: <br> puts &#39;What\\&#39;s your favorite number?&#39;<br>number = gets.chomp<br>outputnumber = number.to_i + 1<br>\nputs outputnumber.to_s + &#39; is a bigger and better favorite number.&#39;<br><br> <br><br> <br>[edit] Strings <br><br>There are a variety of methods of defining strings in Ruby <br><br>The below conventions are equivalent for double quoted strings: <br>\n a = &quot;\\nThis is a double quoted string\\n&quot;<br>a = %Q{\\nThis is a double quoted string\\n}<br>a = &lt;&lt;BLOCK<br>This is a multi-line double quoted string<br>BLOCK<br>a = %/\\nThis is a double quoted string\\n/<br>\n<br> <br><br>The below conventions are equivalent for single quoted strings: <br> a = &#39;This is a single quoted string&#39;<br>a = %q{This is a single quoted string}<br><br> <br><br> <br>[edit] Collections <br><br>Constructing and using an array: <br>\n a = [1, &#39;hi&#39;, 3.14, 1, 2, [4, 5]]<br> <br>a[2] # 3.14<br>a.reverse # [[4, 5], 2, 1, 3.14, &#39;hi&#39;, 1]<br>a.flatten.uniq # [1, &#39;hi&#39;, 3.14, 2, 4, 5]<br><br> <br><br>Constructing and using a hash: <br> hash = { :water =&gt; &#39;wet&#39;, :fire =&gt; &#39;hot&#39; }<br>\nputs hash[:fire] # Prints: hot<br> <br>hash.each_pair do |key, value| # Or: hash.each do |key, value|<br> puts &quot;#{key} is #{value}&quot;<br>end<br> <br># Prints: water is wet<br># fire is hot<br> <br>hash.delete_if {|key, value| key == :water} # Deletes :water =&gt; &#39;wet&#39;<br>\n<br> <br><br> <br>[edit] Blocks and iterators <br><br>The two syntaxes for creating a code block: <br> { puts &quot;Hello, World!&quot; } # Note the { braces }<br> <br>do puts &quot;Hello, World!&quot; end<br><br> <br><br>\nParameter-passing a block to be a closure: <br> # In an object instance variable (denoted with &#39;@&#39;), remember a block.<br>def remember(&amp;a_block)<br> @block = a_block<br>end<br> <br># Invoke the above method, giving it a block that takes a name.<br>\nremember {|name| puts &quot;Hello, #{name}!&quot;}<br> <br># When the time is right (for the object) -- call the closure!<br>@block.call(&quot;Jon&quot;)<br># =&gt; &quot;Hello, Jon!&quot;<br><br> <br><br>Returning closures from a method: <br>\n def create_set_and_get(initial_value=0) # Note the default value of 0<br> closure_value = initial_value<br> return Proc.new {|x| closure_value = x}, Proc.new { closure_value }<br>end<br> <br>setter, getter = create_set_and_get # ie. returns two values<br>\nsetter.call(21)<br>getter.call # =&gt; 21<br><br> <br><br>Yielding the flow of program control to a block which was provided at calling time: <br> def use_hello<br> yield &quot;hello&quot;<br>end<br> <br># Invoke the above method, passing it a block.<br>\nuse_hello {|string| puts string} # =&gt; &#39;hello&#39;<br><br> <br><br>Iterating over enumerations and arrays using blocks: <br> array = [1, &#39;hi&#39;, 3.14]<br>array.each { |item| puts item }<br># =&gt; 1<br># =&gt; &#39;hi&#39;<br>\n# =&gt; 3.14<br> <br>array.each_index { |index| puts index.to_s + &quot;: &quot; + array[index] }<br># =&gt; 0: 1<br># =&gt; 1: &#39;hi&#39;<br># =&gt; 2: 3.14<br> <br>(3..6).each { |num| puts num }<br># =&gt; 3<br># =&gt; 4<br>\n# =&gt; 5<br># =&gt; 6<br><br> <br><br>A method such as inject() can accept both a parameter and a block.

Here, &quot;attr_reader&quot; is an example of metaprogramming in Ruby: &quot;attr_accessor&quot; defines getter and setter methods of instance variables, &quot;attr_reader&quot; only getter methods. Also, the last evaluated statement in a method is its return value, allowing the omission of an explicit &#39;return&#39;. <br>\n class Person<br> def initialize(name, age)<br> @name, @age = name, age<br> end<br> def &lt;=&gt;(person) # Comparison operator for sorting<br> @age &lt;=&gt; person.age<br> end<br> def to_s<br> &quot;#@name (#@age)&quot;<br>\n end<br> attr_reader :name, :age<br>end<br> <br>group = [<br> Person.new(&quot;Jon&quot;, 20), <br> Person.new(&quot;Marcus&quot;, 63), <br> Person.new(&quot;Ash&quot;, 16) <br>]<br> <br>puts group.sort.reverse<br><br> <br>\n<br>The above prints three names in reverse age order: <br> Marcus (63)<br>Jon (20)<br>Ash (16)<br><br> <br><br> <br>[edit] Exceptions <br><br>An exception is raised with a raise call: <br> raise<br><br> <br><br>An optional message can be added to the exception: <br>\n raise &quot;This is a message&quot;<br><br> <br><br>You can also specify which type of exception you want to raise: <br> raise ArgumentError, &quot;Illegal arguments!&quot;<br><br> <br><br>Alternatively, you can pass an exception instance to the raise method: <br>\n raise ArgumentError.new( &quot;Illegal arguments!&quot; )<br><br> <br><br>This last constuct is useful when you need to raise a custom exception class featuring a constructor which takes more than one argument: <br> class ParseError &lt; Exception<br>\n def initialize input, line, pos<br> super &quot;Could not parse &#39;#{input}&#39; at line #{line}, position #{pos}&quot;<br> end<br>end<br> <br>raise ParseError.new( &quot;Foo&quot;, 3, 9 )<br><br> <br><br>Exceptions are handled by the rescue clause.

(February 2008) <br>\nLack of variable declarations -- While this feature, of course, relieves the programmer of much mechanical typing, it also makes a language a poor choice for development of large applications. A simple typo in a variable-name can cause erroneous output from the program, and still go undetected for a long time. Example: <br>\n class Car<br> attr_reader :car_brand<br> attr_reader :car_hps<br> def initialize(driver)<br> @car_brand = &quot;Fiat&quot;<br> @car_hps = 70<br> if driver == &quot;Schumi&quot; then<br> @carbrand=&quot;Ferrari&quot;<br> @car_hps = 600<br>\n end<br> end<br>end<br>c = Car.new(&quot;Schumi&quot;)<br># Schumi will now have a Fiat with 600 hps (which was probably not intended)<br># since you mis-typed carbrand instead of car_brand in the if-clause above.<br># But will anyone notice, before the information gets saved to a database, etc?<br>\n<br> <br><br>A variable can also (intentionally or by programmer mistake) change type in the middle of a code-block by a simple assignment of a new value, which can also introduce undetected errors, and make the code more difficult to grasp and harder to maintain. <br>\nDynamic typing -- Because type-analysis is only done at runtime, errors in code that was never executed can remain undetected for a long time, then suddenly cause a runtime error when the code later happens to be invoked because of new kind of input, etc. With static typing, such errors would be caught at compile-time. <br>\nOverloaded operators -- This feature might be intended to reduce the number of lexical tokens of the language (&quot;keeping the language small&quot;), but also makes the language more error prone. Example: The expression x &lt;&lt; y can mean totally different things, depending on the types of x and y. And if one of the operators have a slightly different type than the programmer thinks, it will still evaluate to a valid expression: <br>\n 3 &lt;&lt; 65 #=&gt; 110680464442257309696<br>[3] &lt;&lt; 65 #=&gt; [3,65]<br>&quot;3&quot; &lt;&lt; 65 #=&gt; &quot;3A&quot;<br>&quot;3&quot; &lt;&lt; &quot;65&quot; #=&gt; &quot;365&quot;<br>[&quot;3&quot;] &lt;&lt; 65 #=&gt; [&quot;3&quot;,65]<br>\n<br> <br><br>Same thing with the + operator which is used for plain numeric addition, but also list-concatenation, and string-concatenation, etc. <br>Reflective and meta-programming features -- While these features can be very interesting in experimental or research-type programming, they are generally poorly suited for business or large-scale application development. It can make the code extremely difficult for another person to grasp, thus making maintenance very burdensome[citation needed]. As an example, you can find a class-definition for an object in one file, but then discover that the definition of that class also changes in several other places during execution, and you may need to look in many different files to understand how that class is actually defined and dynamically evolves. <br>\n<br>Version 1.8, the current stable version of the interpreter, has some limitations, which include: <br>Performance -- the Ruby interpreter&#39;s performance trails that of comparable languages such as Perl, PHP, and Python [3] [4], mainly due to the design of the interpreter: To execute Ruby code, the interpreter builds a syntax tree from the source code and then evaluates the syntax tree directly, instead of first compiling it into more efficiently executable form.<br>\nThreading -- the Ruby threading model uses green threads [5], and its model has some inherent limitations that render it difficult to use or unsafe in some scenarios.[6].<br>Unicode -- Ruby does not yet have native support for Unicode or multibyte strings [7].<br>\nBackward compatibility -- Ruby suffer with backward compatibility problems with old and new version [8]. <br><br>Ruby 2.0 aims to address all of the aforementioned problems: <br>Performance -- a new, faster interpreter, YARV, a virtual machine that executes bytecode instructions, which are in turn compiled into native processor instructions using a JIT compiler.<br>\nThreading -- native threads will be used instead of green threads.[9]<br>Unicode -- full support for Unicode strings. <br><br>Version 1.9, the codebase that is considered the development version of 2.0, was released [10] on 26 December 2007. <br>\n<br>Some problems that may not be solved in version 2.0 include: <br>Ruby still lacks a specification, the current C implementation being the de facto reference specification.

Although the number of applications available does not match the volume of material available in the Perl or Python community, there are a wide range of tools and utilities which serve to foster further development in the language. <br>\n<br>RubyGems has become the standard package manager for Ruby libraries.

It is based on several techniques, including encapsulation,\nmodularity, polymorphism, and inheritance. It was not commonly used in\nmainstream software application development until the early 1990s.\nMany modern programming languages now support OOP.\n\n\nContents [hide]\n1 Introduction\n2 Fundamental concepts\n3 History\n4 OOP in scripting\n5 Problems and patterns\n5.1 Gang of Four design patterns\n5.2 Object-orientation and databases\n5.3 Matching real world\n6 Formal definition\n7 Criticism\n8 See also\n9 References\n10 Further reading\n\n\n[edit] Introduction\n\nObject oriented programming roots reach all the way back to the 1960s.\nAs hardware and software became increasingly complex, researchers\nstudied how software quality could be maintained. Object-oriented\nprogramming was deployed in part as an attempt to address this problem\nby strongly emphasizing discrete units of programming logic and\nre-usability in software.\n\nThe Simula programming language was the first to introduce the\nconcepts underlying object-oriented programming (objects, classes,\nsubclasses, virtual methods, coroutines, garbage collection, and\ndiscrete event simulation) as a superset of Algol. Simula was used for\nphysical modeling, such as models to study and improve the movement of\nships and their content through cargo ports. Smalltalk was the first\nprogramming language to be called \"object-oriented\".\n\nObject-oriented programming may be seen as a collection of cooperating\nobjects, as opposed to a traditional view in which a program may be\nseen as a group of tasks to the computer (\"subroutines\"). In OOP, each\nobject is capable of receiving messages, processing data, and sending\nmessages to other objects.\n\nEach object can be viewed as an independent little machine with a\ndistinct role or responsibility. The actions or \"operators\" on the\nobjects are closely associated with the object. For example, in OOP,\nthe data structures tend to carry their own operators around with them\n(or at least \"inherit\" them from a similar object or \"class\"). The\ntraditional approach tends to view and consider data and behavior\nseparately.\n\n\n[edit] Fundamental concepts\n\nA survey by Deborah J. Armstrong [1] of nearly 40 years of computing\nliterature identified a number of \'quarks\', or fundamental concepts,\nfound in the strong majority of definitions of OOP. They are the\nfollowing: Class A class defines the abstract characteristics of a\nthing (object), including the thing\'s characteristics (its attributes,\nfields or properties) and the thing\'s behaviors (the things it can do,\nor methods, operations or features). One might say that a class is a\nblueprint that describes the nature of something. For example, the\nclass Dog would consist of traits shared by all dogs, such as breed\nand fur color (characteristics), and the ability to bark and sit\n(behaviors). Classes provide modularity and structure in an\nobject-oriented computer program. A class should typically be\nrecognizable to a non-programmer familiar with the problem domain,\nmeaning that the characteristics of the class should make sense in\ncontext. Also, the code for a class should be relatively\nself-contained (generally using encapsulation). Collectively, the\nproperties and methods defined by a class are called members.Object A\nparticular instance of a class. The class of Dog defines all possible\ndogs by listing the characteristics and behaviors they can have; the\nobject Lassie is one particular dog, with particular versions of the\ncharacteristics. A Dog has fur; Lassie has brown-and-white fur. In\nprogrammer jargon, the object Lassie is an instance of the Dog class.\nThe set of values of the attributes of a particular object is called\nits state. The object consists of state and the behaviour that\'s\ndefined in the object\'s class.Method An object\'s abilities. Lassie,\nbeing a Dog, has the ability to bark. So bark() is one of Lassie\'s\nmethods. She may have other methods as well, for example sit() or\neat(). Within the program, using a method usually affects only one\nparticular object; all Dogs can bark, but you need only one particular\ndog to do the barking.Message passing \"The process by which an object\nsends data to another object or asks the other object to invoke a\nmethod.\" [1] Also known to some programming languages as interfacing.\nLassie may give another dog one of her bones. On Java code level\nmessage passing corresponds to \"method calling\".Inheritance\n\'Subclasses\' are more specialized versions of a class, which inherit\nattributes and behaviors from their parent classes, and can introduce\ntheir own.For example, the class Dog might have sub-classes called\nCollie, Chihuahua, and GoldenRetriever. In this case, Lassie would be\nan instance of the Collie subclass. Suppose the Dog class defines a\nmethod called bark() and a property called furColor. Each of its\nsub-classes (Collie, Chihuahua, and GoldenRetriever) will inherit\nthese members, meaning that the programmer only needs to write the\ncode for them once.Each subclass can alter its inherited traits. For\nexample, the Collie class might specify that the default furColor for\na collie is brown-and-white. The Chihuahua subclass might specify that\nthe bark() method produces a high pitch by default. Subclasses can\nalso add new members. The Chihuahua subclass could add a method called\ntremble(). So an individual chihuahua instance would use a\nhigh-pitched bark() from the Chihuahua subclass, which in turn\ninherited the usual bark() from Dog. The chihuahua object would also\nhave the tremble() method, but Lassie would not, because she is a\nCollie, not a Chihuahua. In fact, inheritance is an \'is-a\'\nrelationship: Lassie is a Collie. A Collie is a Dog. Thus, Lassie\ninherits the methods of both Collies and Dogs.Multiple inheritance is\ninheritance from more than one ancestor class, neither of these\nancestors being an ancestor of the other. For example, independent\nclasses could define Dogs and Cats, and a Chimera object could be\ncreated from these two which inherits all the (multiple) behavior of\ncats and dogs. This is not always supported, as it can be hard both to\nimplement and to use well. Encapsulation Encapsulation conceals the\nfunctional details of a class from objects that send messages to\nit.For example, the Dog class has a bark() method. The code for the\nbark() method defines exactly how a bark happens (e.g., by inhale()\nand then exhale(), at a particular pitch and volume). Timmy, Lassie\'s\nfriend, however, does not need to know exactly how she barks.\nEncapsulation is achieved by specifying which classes may use the\nmembers of an object. The result is that each object exposes to any\nclass a certain interface â€” those members accessible to that class.\nThe reason for encapsulation is to prevent clients of an interface\nfrom depending on those parts of the implementation that are likely to\nchange in future, thereby allowing those changes to be made more\neasily, that is, without changes to clients. For example, an interface\ncan ensure that puppies can only be added to an object of the class\nDog by code in that class. Members are often specified as public,\nprotected or private, determining whether they are available to all\nclasses, sub-classes or only the defining class. Some languages go\nfurther: Java uses the default access modifier to restrict access also\nto classes in the same package, C# and VB.NET reserve some members to\nclasses in the same assembly using keywords internal (C#) or Friend\n(VB.NET), and Eiffel and C++ allows one to specify which classes may\naccess any member.Abstraction Abstraction is simplifying complex\nreality by modelling classes appropriate to the problem, and working\nat the most appropriate level of inheritance for a given aspect of the\nproblem.For example, Lassie the Dog may be treated as a Dog much of\nthe time, a Collie when necessary to access Collie-specific attributes\nor behaviors, and as an Animal (perhaps the parent class of Dog) when\ncounting Timmy\'s pets.\n Abstraction is also achieved through Composition. For example, a\nclass Car would be made up of an Engine, Gearbox, Steering objects,\nand many more components. To build the Car class, one does not need to\nknow how the different components work internally, but only how to\ninterface with them, i.e., send messages to them, receive messages\nfrom them, and perhaps make the different objects composing the class\ninteract with each other.Polymorphism Polymorphism allows you to treat\nderived class members just like their parent class\' members. More\nprecisely, Polymorphism in object-oriented programming is the ability\nof objects belonging to different data types to respond to method\ncalls of methods of the same name, each one according to an\nappropriate type-specific behavior. One method, or an operator such as\n+, -, or *, can be abstractly applied in many different situations. If\na Dog is commanded to speak(), this may elicit a bark(). However, if a\nPig is commanded to speak(), this may elicit an oink(). They both\ninherit speak() from Animal, but their derived class methods override\nthe methods of the parent class; this is Overriding Polymorphism.\nOverloading Polymorphism is the use of one method signature, or one\noperator such as \'+\', to perform several different functions depending\non the implementation. The \'+\' operator, for example, may be used to\nperform integer addition, float addition, list concatenation, or\nstring concatenation. Any two subclasses of Number, such as Integer\nand Double, are expected to add together properly in an OOP language.\nThe language must therefore overload the concatenation operator, \'+\',\nto work this way. This helps improve code readability. How this is\nimplemented varies from language to language, but most OOP languages\nsupport at least some level of overloading polymorphism. Many OOP\nlanguages also support Parametric Polymorphism, where code is written\nwithout mention of any specific type and thus can be used\ntransparently with any number of new types. Pointers are an example of\na simple polymorphic routine that can be used with many different\ntypes of objects.[2]\n\nNot all of the above concepts are to be found in all object-oriented\nprogramming languages, and so object-oriented programming that uses\nclasses is called sometimes class-based programming. In particular,\nprototype-based programming does not typically use classes. As a\nresult, a significantly different yet analogous terminology is used to\ndefine the concepts of object and instance, although there are no\nobjects in these languages.\n\n\n[edit] History\n\nThe concept of objects and instances in computing had its first major\nbreakthrough with the PDP-1 system at MIT which was probably the\nearliest example of capability based architecture. Another early\nexample was Sketchpad made by Ivan Sutherland in 1963; however, this\nwas an application and not a programming paradigm. Objects as\nprogramming entities were introduced in the 1960s in Simula 67, a\nprogramming language designed for making simulations, created by\nOle-Johan Dahl and Kristen Nygaard of the Norwegian Computing Center\nin Oslo. (Reportedly, the story is that they were working on ship\nsimulations, and were confounded by the combinatorial explosion of how\nthe different attributes from different ships could affect one\nanother. The idea occurred to group the different types of ships into\ndifferent classes of objects, each class of objects being responsible\nfor defining its own data and behavior.) Such an approach was a simple\nextrapolation of concepts earlier used in analog programming. On\nanalog computers, such direct mapping from real-world\nphenomena/objects to analog phenomena/objects (and conversely), was\n(and is) called \'simulation\'. Simula not only introduced the notion of\nclasses, but also of instances of classes, which is probably the first\nexplicit use of those notions.\n\nThe Smalltalk language, which was developed at Xerox PARC in the\n1970s, introduced the term Object-oriented programming to represent\nthe pervasive use of objects and messages as the basis for\ncomputation. Smalltalk creators were influenced by the ideas\nintroduced in Simula 67, but Smalltalk was designed to be a fully\ndynamic system in which classes could be created and modified\ndynamically rather than simply using static ones as in Simula 67.[3]\nThe ideas in Simula 67 were also used in many other languages, from\nderivatives of Lisp to Pascal.\n\nObject-oriented programming developed as the dominant programming\nmethodology during the mid-1990s, largely due to the influence of\nC++[citation needed]. Its dominance was further cemented by the rising\npopularity of graphical user interfaces, for which object-oriented\nprogramming is well-suited. An example of a closely related dynamic\nGUI library and OOP language can be found in the Cocoa frameworks on\nMac OS X, written in Objective C, an object-oriented, dynamic\nmessaging extension to C based on Smalltalk. OOP toolkits also\nenhanced the popularity of event-driven programming (although this\nconcept is not limited to OOP). Some feel that association with GUIs\n(real or perceived) was what propelled OOP into the programming\nmainstream.\n\nAt ETH ZÃ¼rich, Niklaus Wirth and his colleagues had also been\ninvestigating such topics as data abstraction and modular programming.\nModula-2 included both, and their succeeding design, Oberon, included\na distinctive approach to object orientation, classes, and such. The\napproach is unlike Smalltalk, and very unlike C++.\n\nObject-oriented features have been added to many existing languages\nduring that time, including Ada, BASIC, Lisp, Fortran, Pascal, and\nothers. Adding these features to languages that were not initially\ndesigned for them often led to problems with compatibility and\nmaintainability of code.\n\nIn the past decade Java has emerged in wide use partially because of\nits similarity to C and to C++, but perhaps more importantly because\nof its implementation using a virtual machine that is intended to run\ncode unchanged on many different platforms. This last feature has made\nit very attractive to larger development shops with heterogeneous\nenvironments. Microsoft\'s .NET initiative has a similar objective and\nincludes/supports several new languages, or variants of older ones.\n\nMore recently, a number of languages have emerged that are primarily\nobject-oriented yet compatible with procedural methodology, such as\nPython and Ruby. Besides Java, probably the most commercially\nimportant recent object-oriented languages are Visual Basic .NET and\nC# designed for Microsoft\'s .NET platform.\n\nJust as procedural programming led to refinements of techniques such\nas structured programming, modern object-oriented software design\nmethods include refinements such as the use of design patterns, design\nby contract, and modeling languages (such as UML).\n\n\n[edit] OOP in scripting\n\nIn recent years, object-oriented programming has become especially\npopular in scripting programming languages. Python and Ruby are\nscripting languages built on OOP principles, while Perl and PHP have\nbeen adding object oriented features since Perl 5 and PHP 4, and\nColdFusion since version 6.\n\nThe Document Object Model of HTML, XHTML, and XML documents on the\nInternet have bindings to the popular JavaScript/ECMAScript language.\nJavaScript is perhaps the best known prototype-based programming\nlanguage which employs cloning from prototypes rather than inheriting\nfrom a class.\n\n\n[edit] Problems and patterns\n\nThere are a number of programming challenges which a developer\nencounters regularly in object-oriented design. There are also widely\naccepted solutions to these problems. The best known are the design\npatterns codified by Gamma et al, but in a broader sense the term\n\"design patterns\" can be used to refer to any general, repeatable\nsolution to a commonly occurring problem in software design. Some of\nthese commonly occurring problems have implications and solutions\nparticular to object-oriented development.\n\n\n[edit] Gang of Four design patterns\nMain article: Design Patterns\n\nDesign Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software is an\ninfluential book published in 1995 by Erich Gamma, Richard Helm, Ralph\nJohnson, and John Vlissides, sometimes casually called the \"Gang of\nFour.\" Along with exploring the capabilities and pitfalls of\nobject-oriented programming, it describes 23 common programming\nproblems and patterns for solving them. As of April 2007, the book was\nin its 36th printing. Typical design patterns are as follows:\n\n\nCreational patterns\nFactory Pattern\nAbstract Factory Pattern\nSingleton Pattern\nBuilder pattern\nPrototype pattern\n\nStructural patterns\nAdapter Pattern\nBridge Pattern\nComposite Pattern\nDecorator Pattern\nFacade Pattern\nFlyweight Pattern\nProxy pattern\n\nBehavioral patterns\nChain of Responsibility Pattern\nCommand Pattern\nInterpreter Pattern\nIterator Pattern\nMediator Pattern\nMemento Pattern\nObserver Pattern\nState pattern\nStrategy Pattern\nTemplate Pattern\nVisitor Pattern\n\n\n[edit] Object-orientation and databases\nMain articles: Object-Relational impedance mismatch, Object-relational\nmapping, and Object database\n\nBoth object-oriented programming and relational database management\nsystems (RDBMSs) are extremely common in software today. Since\nrelational databases don\'t store objects directly (though some RDBMSs\nhave object-oriented features to approximate this), there is a general\nneed to bridge the two worlds. There are a number of widely used\nsolutions to this problem. One of the most common is object-relational\nmapping, as found in libraries like Java Data Objects, and Ruby on\nRails\' ActiveRecord.\n\nThere are also object databases which can be used to replace RDBMSs,\nbut these have not been as commercially successful as RDBMSs.\n\n\n[edit] Matching real world\n\nOOP can be used to translate from real-world phenomena to program\nelements (and vice versa). OOP was even invented for the purpose of\nphysical modeling in the Simula-67 programming language. However, not\neveryone agrees that direct real-world mapping is facilitated by OOP,\nor is even a worthy goal; Bertrand Meyer argues in Object-Oriented\nSoftware Construction [4] that a program is not a model of the world\nbut a model of some part of the world; \"Reality is a cousin twice\nremoved\". At the same time, some principal limitations of OOP had been\nnoted. [5]\n\n\n[edit] Formal definition\n\nThere have been several attempts at formalizing the concepts used in\nobject-oriented programming. The following concepts and constructs\nhave been used as interpretations of OOP concepts:\ncoalgebraic datatypes\nexistential quantification and modules\nrecursion\nrecords and record extensions\nF-bounded polymorphism\n\nAttempts to find a consensus definition or theory behind objects have\nnot proven very successful (however, see \"Abadi & Cardelli: A Theory\nof Objects\" [6] for formal definitions of many OO concepts and\nconstructs), and often diverge widely. For example, some definitions\nfocus on mental activities, and some on mere program structuring. One\nof the simpler definitions is that OOP is the act of using \"map\" data\nstructures or arrays that can contain functions and pointers to other\nmaps, all with some syntactic and scoping sugar on top. Inheritance\ncan be performed by cloning the maps (sometimes called \"prototyping\").\n\n\n[edit] Criticism\nRichard Stallman wrote in 1995, \"Adding OOP to Emacs is not clearly an\nimprovement; I used OOP when working on the Lisp Machine window\nsystems, and I disagree with the usual view that it is a superior way\nto program.\"[7]\nA study by Potok et al. [8] has shown no significant difference in\nproductivity between OOP and procedural approaches.\nChristopher J. Date stated that critical comparison of OOP to other\ntechnologies, relational in particular, is difficult because of lack\nof an agreed-upon and rigorous definition of OOP.[9]\nAlexander Stepanov suggested that OOP provides a\nmathematically-limited viewpoint and called it, \"almost as much of a\nhoax as Artificial Intelligence\" (possibly referring to the Artificial\nIntelligence projects and marketing of the 1980s that are sometimes\nviewed as overzealous in retrospect)[10][11].\nEdsger W. Dijkstra wrote:\n\n\n... what society overwhelmingly asks for is snake oil. Of course, the\nsnake oil has the most impressive names â€”otherwise you would be\nselling nothingâ€” like \"Structured Analysis and Design\", \"Software\nEngineering\", \"Maturity Models\", \"Management Information Systems\",\n\"Integrated Project Support Environments\" \"Object Orientation\" and\n\"Business Process Re-engineering\" (the latter three being known as\nIPSE, OO and BPR, respectively).\" â€” EWD 1175: The strengths of the\nacademic enterprise\n\n\n[edit] See also\n\nObject-oriented programming language\nAspect-oriented programming\nProcedural programming\nObject-oriented analysis and design\nCircle-ellipse problem\nSoftware componentry\nInterface description language\nList of object-oriented programming terms\nRefactoring\nCORBA\nDCOM\nObject-relational mapping\nObject-Relational impedance mismatch (and The Third Manifesto)\nObject database\nObject-oriented image classification\nConstructor overloading\n\n\n[edit] References\n\n[edit] Further reading\n\n\n\nWikibooks\' [[wikibooks:|]] has more about this subject:\nComputer programming/Object oriented programming\n\n\n\nAt Wikiversity you can learn about Object-oriented programming at:\nTopic:Object-Oriented Programming\nAbadi, Martin; Luca Cardelli.

We are building an open, world-wide community of users and\ndevelopers, and continuing UIMA\'s evolution using the Open Source\ndevelopement paradigm.\n\nIn addition to IBM, many universities and industrial organizations are\nusing UIMA to develop analysis engines and UIM solutions.\nUIMA Innovation Awards\n\nIBM has established an award program for University Faculty called the\nUIMA Innovation Awards, and given it for the past several years, to\nencourage building the community around UIMA. More information on this\nprogram can be found at here.\nUIMA is being Standardized at OASIS\n\nUIMA is undergoing a standardization effort at OASIS, via the OASIS\nUnstructured Information Management Architecture (UIMA) TC, working on\nstandardizing semantic search and content analytics. This committee,\nopen to all interested parties who are members of OASIS, has been\nmeeting regularly, and plans to publish a first draft of their work in\nearly 2008.\nThird Party Vendors and UIMA\n\nA host of third-party vendors have announced their use of UIMA to wrap\nand deploy their analysis capabilities and to build UIMA-based\nsolutions. For details see the August 2005 OmniFind Press Release.\nYou can find more UIMA annotators on the internet using the internet\nsearch engines with the phrase \"uima annotators\". Carnegie Mellon\nUniversity and Jena University both have repositories of UIMA\ncomponents.\n\nTo learn more about UIMA as a open platform for building unstructured\ninformation and knowledge management applications read on.\n\n    *\n\n      Unstructured Information â€“ The Knowledge Rush\n    *\n\n      Architecture Highlights\n    *\n\n      UIMA and Semantic Search\n    *\n\n      UIMA Availability\n    *\n\n      UIMA Projects at IBM Research\n\n\n\n\nAttached file: IndustrialStrength.png\n\nLast updated 17 Sep 2007\n\n	  	\nResearchers\n\n\n\n  Research labs involved\n\nAlmaden Research Center, China Research Lab, Haifa Research Lab, India\nResearch Lab, Tokyo Research Lab, Watson Research Center (Hawthorne),\nWatson Research Center (Yorktown), Watson Research Center\n\n\n    About IBM	    	Privacy	    	Contact\n\n\n-- \n-Suman\n',1,NULL,10,953125641,'2008-02-06 15:05:11','2008-02-06 15:05:11');
